    " Q1- Which of the following can be used to replace missing code so that the code segment works as intended?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: #B This is because the variable second is equal to first, which is equal to temp. So temp equals the variable temp.\n",
    "\n",
    " Q4- A student is writing a program to model different real-world events using simulations. Which of the following simulations will generate a result that would best be stored using a Boolean variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: #A This is because the simulation is modeling a situation where the outcome is either true or false. The coin is 50/50 so the outcome is either heads or tails.\n",
    "\n",
    " Q7- What is displayed as a result of executing the program?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: #C The values 1 and 3 are the original values of start and current, not the final values. The final values are 3 and 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9- Which of the following best describes one of the benefits of using an iterative and incremental process of program development?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: #D  Incrementally adding code segments to correct, working programs can help programmers identify new errors that are introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q20- A programmer would like to find the greatest of three integer values a, b, and c. Which of the following expressions will produce the desired result in every case?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: #A This expression will first determine the maximum of a and b and then determine the maximum of the resulting value and c. This will result in the maximum of all three values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q21- Which of the following code segments will move the robot to the gray square?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: #B This is because the code moves the object two blocks forwards, rotates it three times to the right then moves it forward three blocks forward\n",
    "\n",
    "Q25- For which of the following strings is it NOT possible to use byte pair encoding to shorten the string’s length?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: #B It is not possible to use byte pair encoding in the string Open quotation, LEVEL, underscore, UP, close quotationbecause no pair of characters appears in the string more than once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q26- Which of the following replacements for missing code can be used to move the robot to the gray square?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: #A This code segment rotates right whenever there is an open square to the right. The robot will move forward from its initial location to the upper-left corner of the grid, then rotate right, then move forward to the upper-right corner of the grid, then rotate right, then move down two squares, then rotate right, then move forward to the gray square.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q30- Which of the following best approximates the amount of time it takes the program to execute?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: #D  Each call to the Analysis procedure requires one hour of program execution time. The procedure is called\n",
    "\n",
    "Q31- Which of the following statements is true?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: #C Program I correctly moves the robot to the gray square by repeatedly moving the robot forward, rotating left, moving forward, and rotating right. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q43- Based on the values in the table, which of the following best characterizes the algorithm for very large values of n?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: #A The pattern in the table appears to indicate that there are n squared steps for a list containing n items. This number of steps is a polynomial and therefore the algorithm runs in reasonable time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q48- Which of the following can be used to replace missing code so that the simulation works as intended?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: #D This option causes the experiment to be successful when RANDOM, open parenthesis 1 comma 100, close parenthesis produces a result from 1 to 7 5, or 75% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q52- Executing which of the following sequences of steps will enable the algorithm to work as intended?\n",
    "\n",
    "I. First shorten, then keep palindromes, then sort\n",
    "\n",
    "II. First keep palindromes, then shorten, then sort\n",
    "\n",
    "III. First sort, then keep palindromes, then shorten\n",
    "\n",
    "A: #D Options II and III perform the steps in a correct order. In order to generate the desired list, the algorithm must perform the \"shorten\" step after the \"keep palindromes\" step, otherwise the \"keep palindromes\" step would not be able to determine whether the original word was a palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q60- Which of the following are ways in which a programmer can use abstraction to manage the complexity of a program?\n",
    "\n",
    "Select two answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A: #A,D Creating a list of names is an example of a data abstraction that may make it easier for a programmer to manage the complexity of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q64- Which of the following statements describe how cloud computing has affected Internet communication?\n",
    "\n",
    "Select two answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A: #B,C Cloud computing sites must consider security concerns in order to protect their users’ private data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q66- For which of the following values of One word, the List will Smallest, open parenthesis, one word, the List, close parenthesis NOT return the intended value?\n",
    "\n",
    "Select two answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A: #C,D The procedure returns the first number it encounters that is less than the first number in the list. For the list open bracket, 30, 40, 20, 10, close bracket, the procedure returns 2 0, which is not the least value in the list."
